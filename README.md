Just a simple 2D Chess. Works with two players on the same computer and one player against an "AI".
The AI creates a search where every branch is a possible move and does this multiple times til it gives each branch a value by the standing pieces on the last calculated move. So don't be suprised when it takes a lot of a lot of time to make a really bad move.
Don't worry to try the network mode. It's not implemented yet.
